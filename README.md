# evcc Native App

Native app wrapper for evcc UI based on [react-native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/). It uses [UI Kitten / Eva](https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/) as a design system. Native parts are written in TypeScript and kept to a minimum.

## Known limitations

- No support for multiple instances [#3](https://github.com/evcc-io/app/issues/3)

We'll work on these in a future release. Feel free to vote üëç to help priorization and add new feature ideas.
